TSP-Gen : A study of the "island model" for distributed Genetic Algorithms.

INSTALLATION :
-OpenMPI :  sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin

EXECUTION

-Sequential version :
	Go to TSP-Gen/sequentiel
	make
	The executable "genetic" will be created

	There is two ways to execute the program
		- manually :
			./genetic <dataFile> <configFile>
			example : ./genetic ../data/graphe4.txt ../configurations/param.cfg
		- via a shell script :
			go to to TSP-Gen/
			./sequentialExecutor.sh <N>
				N represents the number of execution you want
				The script will executre N times the program with a predetermined data file 
				for each configuration file in the configurations folder

			The output result will be written to the "result" file.

-Distributed version :
	Go to TSP-Gen/distributed
	make
	The executable "genetic" will be created

	mpirun -c <N> ./genetic <dataFile> <configFile>
	example : mpirun -c 2 ./genetic ../data/graphe4.txt ../configurations/param.cfg
	N represents the number of processes that will be used during the execution
